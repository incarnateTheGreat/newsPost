News Post w/ Angular 4.

## Prerequisites
* NodeJS

## How to Install
If you have both NodeJS and Angular 4 installed, then proceed to the following steps:

1) In your command prompt, run 'git clone https://github.com/incarnateTheGreat/newsPost.git'
2) Once the clone is complete, go into the base directory that was recently spawned by the Clone function and type 'npm install'
3) Run 'ng serve'. The localhost should point to the 4200 port, but make sure from the ng stacktrace of the local URL. Here's an example:
